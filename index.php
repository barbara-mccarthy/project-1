<h2>Who am I and what do I do?</h2>
	<div>
	  <p>I am a 46-year-old female who's lived in Boston's South End neighborhood for more than 14 years. I love to exercise and escape with books. I spend most weekends, April through November, at our cottage on <a href="http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/3001813.jpg">Lake Winnisquam</a> in the lakes region of New Hampshire. I love dogs (specifically my <a href="sydney.png">Shiba Inu Syndey</a>) and all types of music. Orange is one of my favorite colors. I have a slight obsession with ostriches.</p>
	  <p>I've been the Web Communications Specialist at Harvard's Nieman Foundation for Journalism for almost eight years.</p>
	</div>
    <h2>Why am I taking this course?</h2>
	<div>
	  <p>I'm taking this course because the websites at work were recently redesigned. They are build on Wordpress and our web developer has us working with Git and GitHub. I want to understanding WHAT I'm doing and WHY, rather than just following along the instructions because that is what I was told I should do. I also want to learn PHP so I can edit and create pages on our site.
	  <p></div>
    <h2>What previous experience do I have with programming?</h2>
	<div>
	  <p>I can manipulate existing JavaScript to suit my needs occasionally. Since the work web redesign, I've learned a little about PHP, but not much.</p></div>
    <h2>What am I working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform??</h2>
	<div>
	  <p>I work with Macs at work and that is my preferred platform. I have a PC at home, but most my home computing is done on an iPad.</p></div>
    <h2>Anything else?</h2>
	<div>
	  <p>I'm really enjoying this class so far. I originally chose this class because it had &quot;PHP&quot; in the description. Come to find out, the very first class starts talking about MAMP, Git, GitHub, SSH, local servers, etc. I knew immediately I was in the right place.</p></div>
